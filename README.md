# Rock-Knowledge-Game

Last year in our Geology 2 course we learnt a lot about the rock cycle. We can divide these rocks in three groups: sediments, igneous and metamorphic rocks. Furthermore, sediments can also be divided into clastic or chemical, igneous rocks into extrusive and intrusive and so on.

Your goal is to figure out the random chosen rock in as few guesses as possible. Wrong guesses will narrow down the answer. The more your guess has in common with the answer, the more you will learn about the random chosen rock.

You could compare this project to a Guess Who game which can also be created in Python. This project is inspired by a online game called ‘Metazooa’ where you can daily guess an animal.

I will need a database, ‘TkInter’ and a lot of ‘IF’s for this project. I could also use other GUI frameworks or toolkits to make it look prettier.
Data that I would need is the different type of rocks we got to learn in our Geology 2 course.
I expect this project to take a lot of time but it will eventually work out. I hope the game will also look nice and not too chaotic. Eventually it is all about having no bugs and if it works.
