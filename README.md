# HangMan

Everyone knows the game hangman. Someone comes up with a word and the other people need to guess the word by guessing the letters. If you guess the wrong letter the other would draw parts of a stick-man.
I will try to recreate this game in Python by creating an input for the word and printing images or letters when the other tries to guess.
